# Guide

Welcome stranger! 
This is the official guide to the *ft_framework*. I hope you have a great time here.


## I mean, why not?

I was struggling with C. I wanted to use hash tables. Oh, but they don't exist. Dynamic arrays? Sorry, what's that? Maybe a string? Unfortunately that's not happening. Hmm. And what about memory management? Can I just exit the program and be happy? No, there may be a leak. Oh, so can I just call one function and be free? No, it's not how it works. Damn it!

I wanted to be able to focus on the problem. I just hate it to keep paying attention to those nitty-gritty details that nobody cares about when using a more high level language like Python.

So out of frustation I started looking for solutions. I experimented quite a lot before getting to something cool. I tried different approaches and tried to combine them in many ways. Fun fact is I got inspired to create a programming language. It seems like a rewarding adventure. Maybe one day. Who knows? Anyways, I got to something I'm proud of.

Welcome to **ft_framework**! Or, as I prefer to call it, **Trillian**. Enjoy!


## It works on my machine.

Before getting to the deep dive, you should make it works on yours too. So get ready!

Clone it to a comfortable folder in your machine using the command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brenohildebrand/ft_framework.git
```

And create an alias for the script located at `scripts/ft.sh`. Call it trillian or whatever you want.


## Bring your best towel!

non-destructive  
ft_type() is the signature function  


## Go hack it!

Congratulations for reading this far. Now you know how to use the wannabe famous *ft_framework*. Since you got the power you can do whatever you want with it. Make it better, make it yours. And if you fell like contributing just check out [this](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

May your code be bug-free. See ya!
