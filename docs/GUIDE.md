# Guide

Welcome! This is the right place to learn how ft_framework works.

## Overview


## Installation

Go to a pretty cool folder and clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brenohildebrand/ft_framework
```

Then create an alias for the ft script.

```bash
cd ft_framework
echo "alias ft=$(pwd)/scripts/ft.sh" >> ~/.bash_aliases
```

Don't just copy and paste the last command. Make sure it makes sense for your system first.
