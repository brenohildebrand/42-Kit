# Guide

Welcome stranger! 
This is the official guide to the *ft_framework*. I hope you have a great time here.

## It works on my machine.

Before getting to the deep dive, you should make it works on yours too. Start by cloning it to a comfortable folder on your computer.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brenohildebrand/ft_framework.git
```

Now add `ft_framework/trillian/bin` to your `$PATH`. And that's it.

> **Notice**  
You may want to tinker the configuration files. You actually need to if you want this framework to work properly.

## Bring your best towel!

If you don't already know, a project using this framework can be initialized with ```trillian init```. It will create the directories needed and you can start coding right away.

Every source code you create should be under source and every test should be under tests.

trillian is a cool and helpful tool

You got to use types and functions

two ways to build your code ... build and debug  
run with trillian run

create your own types  
expand the framework

system call errors will make the program to exit  
if you want to avoid that check for whatever you need before calling the function  
(i.e. check if path exists before creating a file)

## Go hack it!

Congratulations for reading this far. Now you know how to use the wannabe famous *ft_framework*. Since you got the power you can do whatever you want with it. Make it better, make it yours. And if you fell like contributing just check out [this](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

May your code be bug-free. See ya!
