# ft_framework

This is `ft_framework`, a tool to harness the conveniences of higher-level languages in C programming. It simplifies memory management and includes essential data structures like lists and maps, sparing you the hassle of reinventing the wheel. It also comes with a CLI tool to help with building, testing and submitting your projects. Beware though that you can't use it directly due to ownership rules. You can, however, draw inspiration from it to develop your own version and I may help you do just that.

Get started by reading the [guide](docs/GUIDE.md).
